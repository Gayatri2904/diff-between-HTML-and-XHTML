HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, while XHTML stands for Extensible Hyper Text Markup Language.
HTML is less strict with rules, whereas XHTML is more strict and follows XML rules.
In HTML, tags are not case-sensitive (you can write <TITLE> or <title>), but in XHTML, tags must be lowercase
In HTML, some tags don't need closing (like <br>), but in XHTML, all tags must be closed (like <br />).
In HTML, quotes around attribute values (like type=text) are optional, but in XHTML, quotes are required (type="text").
HTML allows some errors in code, and the browser will still display the page, but XHTML requires well-formed code with no errors.
XHTML is better for integration with XML tools and applications, while HTML is more browser-friendly and widely used.
